ABOUT US

La Casa Boutique is a boutique guesthouse located in the center of Kostinbrod.
It is a natural continuation of the Gerasimov family’s long-standing dedication to quality, coziness, and detail. At its core stands the experience and prestige gained over the years with Navona Restaurant, established in 1999 with the same devotion to hospitality and authentic ambiance. With equal attention and consistency, the guesthouse was built step by step as a family endeavor.

Every space in La Casa Boutique has its own unique character. The house offers five rooms — Alexandria, Sofia, Roma, Wien, The Royal Suite — and one apartment, The Golden Suite. The interior is carefully crafted with handmade Italian furniture by Silik, an Italian brand with a long-standing tradition in the baroque style, offering a refined balance between classic lines and contemporary feel.
Each detail has its place, and every room has its own personality and aura.
La Casa Boutique greets its guests with calm rhythm and grace, a space marked by its unique touch — refined, harmonious, and built with care and consistency.

Coming soon, La Casa Boutique will offer even more amenities — new rooms, a relaxation area with jacuzzi, sauna, and a salt room, providing even more complete care and tranquility.
