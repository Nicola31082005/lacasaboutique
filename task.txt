So chat we are going to create a SPA React website for a hotel called La Casa Botique - GF. What I want is the follwong implementaion: We need in the home page a larger screen carousel that will be changing some of the main hotel pictures in a big size. Under those carousel with moving picture I would like to have an Intorudction heading with something small. Under it I would like to have order now button that will point to a booking page. Under it I would like to have a smaller cards that are going to be the rooms with a short descirption abouot them. And they are also going to be moving. Also I would like to have a navigation menu with only hone; rooms; about us. In the home page I would like ot have a cart with the specified location of the hotel. Also I would like to have to languages in the web application: English, and Bulgarian. Think about some approach like a context, redux or something like that that can implement the functionality of changing the language of the app. I would like the app to start with a page where you are going to choose between the two language models of the app. Now create instructions of implementing all of this functionality as for a cursor AI model that will implement all of this.  ;
